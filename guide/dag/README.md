# Running your first DAG 

By the end of this guide, we will have accomplished:
* Create and configure 2 Airflow connections
  * Fivetran
  * Google Cloud
* Create 2 Airflow Variables
  * connector_id
  * gcp_project_id
* Deploying DAG to Airflow `/dags` directory in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* Enabling DAG in Airflow UI
